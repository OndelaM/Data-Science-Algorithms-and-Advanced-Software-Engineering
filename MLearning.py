#1. Comment on the differences between supervised and unsupervised machine
#learning, as well what you think semi-supervised machine learning is.

#Supervised learning uses labeled data and deals with classification.
#It uses regression to predict trends based on previous labeled data

#Semi-supervised learning
#This is somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learning.
#We can use some labelled data (ie a scenario where there is simply too much data to label it manually)
#The machine takes in a portion of the data, comes up with a way of identifying it and then applies it to the entire data set.

#Unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data. It uses clustering to find patterns and groupings

#2. Write a paragraph on Machine Learning

#Machine learning is the process of a machine producing a specific output that it
#has not been explicitly programmed to do. It is extremely useful, as programming
#an algorithm that is capable of returning this output can get extremely complex
#especially when you consider that new data can potentially change the way that the decision is made
#This could potentially lead to having to rewrite the code numerous times on
#an ongoing basis. When it comes to more complex types of data or expected
#output. it could potentially become impossible to maintain this kind of algorithm.
#In a sense you could say that machine learning differs from standard programming
#in that instead of taking in input and returning output. It takes in input as well as output
#in order to return more sophisticated output.

#3. Write a paragraph on Supervised Learning.

#Supervised learning uses labeled data and deals with classification.
#As well as regression in order to predict trends based on previous labeled data.
#Labelled data is data that we already know the target answer for and we can
#choose certain characteristics to feed the machine to see if it can pick up patterns
#that will help it predict cases without being shown a label.
#It can also use regression to predict a value based on previous known examples.

#Examples of supervised learning models are
#Risk Assessment
#Image Classification
#Fraud Decision
#Visual Recognition
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#4.Write a paragraph on Unsupervised Learning.

#Unspupervised learning uses unlabelled data. It uses clustering in order to find patterns
#which it will use to predict certain factors of future data.
#Unspupervised learning will attempt to identify patterns, which tell the machine that
#a certain event is likely to occur based on previous trends.
#Unsupervised learning has no feedback mechanism

#Examples of unspervised learning models are
#Market Basket Analysis
#Semantic Clustering
#Identify Accident Prone Areas
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
#5. Write a paragraph on 1 interesting trend in Artificial Intelligence that interest you.

#A trend in artificial intelligence that interests me is Music recommendation. I think this interests me the most for 2 reasons.
#I am a musician myself, trying to figure out how to get my music onto more people's recommendations.
#As well as I find it fascinating how differently the various apps go about doing it (not the mechanisms, but the results) for instance Play Music very seldomnly
#recommends me something that I enjoy, while Spotify gets it right pretty much all of the time, introducing me to artists I would never have heard before.
#I am sure that part of it is using the Market Basket analysis method, which I think in this particular circumstance it can throw out the results
#in that popular music that is receiving a lot of play time are going to be given too much weight, and ending up in a loop where they are the ony artists getting recommended
#I think this was very much the case with the Play Music algorithm, but Spotify must have some extra factors involved with theirs.
#I am sure they must be using some kind of way to tranform certain aspects into concrete characteristics, such as tempo, key. Perhaps getting users to
#tag a certain mood of a song, what time of day most people listen to the song etc.
